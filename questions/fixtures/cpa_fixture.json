On 1 April 2018, Rono opened a business bank account and deposited Sh.500,000 of his own personal savings into the account. He also introduced into the business cash amounting to Sh.70,000 and equipment worth Sh.150,000 from his house. The cash was retained in the business's cash box.</p>\n<p>2. On 1 April 2018, Rono signed a lease agreement for the premises which required that he pays Sh.120,000 in rent per year. Mr. Rono paid this by cheque through the business account.</p>\n<p>3. During the year, the premises were repainted at a cost of Sh.7,500 which was paid in cash from Rono's private funds. The paint was bought by Rono at Sh.35,000 which was paid by cheque through the business account. Rono also bought furniture at a cost of Sh.120,000 which was paid by cheque through the business account. In addition, Rono bought a safe at Sh.30,000 which was also paid for by cheque through the business account.</p>\n<p>4. On 1 April 2018, Rono borrowed Sh.90,000 from a friend and the funds were deposited into the business bank account. Rono was to pay interest of 10% per annum on the loan. The term of the loan is three years. The loan interest was still unpaid as at 31 March 2019.</p>\n<p>5. Most of Rono's sales were in cash. Cash is deposited into the business bank account every week. During the year, cash sales amounted to Sh.100,000 per week except for the five weeks of December where due to the Christmas festivities, weekly sales increased by 80% of cash sales. Assume that one year has 52 weeks.</p>\n<p>6. Rono also has corporate clients that are invoiced after hosting their events in the restaurant. Rono raised invoices amounting to Sh.780,000 in relation to the corporate clients during the year and had received and lodged into the business bank account Sh.620,000 by year end.</p>\n<p>7. Rono maintains a file where all records are held. A summary of this file is as follows:</p>\n<p>- Inventory purchased on credit during the year amounted to Sh.2,600,000 of which Rono estimated that there was Sh.235,000 of inventory at the year end.</p>\n<p>- The amount owed to suppliers was Sh.300,000 at the year end.</p>\n<p>- Electricity bills averaged Sh.26,000 per month and were paid in cash. The bill for March 2019 was paid in April 2019.</p>\n<p>- Salaries and wages for the year amounted to 20% of cash sales. These were paid in cash.</p>\n<p>- Consumables used amounted to Sh.120,000 during the year. They were paid for in cash.</p>\n<p>- Miscellaneous expenses for the year paid for in cash amounted to Sh.43,000.</p>\n<p>- Insurance expenses for the year amounted to Sh.90,000. These were paid for by cheque through the business bank account.</p>\n<p>8. Rono feels that it is appropriate to depreciate all the assets of the business at the rate of 15% per annum on cost regardless of the date of purchase. The safe is not to be depreciated.</p>\n<p>9. During the year, Rono withdrew Sh.20,000 per month in cash for his private use. He also took Sh.20,000 worth of inventory out of the business to host his daughter's birthday party.</p>\n<p><b>Required:</b></p>\n<p>(a) Income statement for the year ended 31 March 2019.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(12 marks)</p>\n<p>(b) Statement of financial position as at 31 March 2019.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(8 marks)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>(Total: 20 marks)</b></p>"

The bank had erroneously credited KK Ltd. with an amount of Sh.2,510,000.</p>\n<p>3. Direct deposits by debtors amounted to Sh.13,080,000.

The cash book as at 31 December 2017 showed a balance at bank of Sh.6,440,000. Your attention, however, has been drawn to the following matters:</p>\n<p>1. Cheques from customers totalling Sh.4,980,000 which were recorded in the cash book on 29 December 2017, were actually not credited by the bank until 2 January 2018.</p>\n<p>2. Cheques issued on 31 December 2017 totalling Sh.7,420,000 in favour of suppliers were not paid by the bank until after the end of the year (that is, after 31 December 2017).</p>\n<p>3. On 22 November 2017, the bank paid an amount of Sh.3,600,000 with respect to a standing order from UTE for rent of business premises for the three months to 31 January 2018 but, unfortunately, no entry for this payment had been made in the cash book. Additionally, no record of this rent had been made in the income statement for the period.</p>\n<p>4. On 31 December 2017, Mr. Ken Abusi, a customer, had paid Sh.2,340,000 directly into UTE's bank account in full settlement of a debt of Sh.2,400,000 owing to UTE but no entry had been made in the books.</p>\n<p>5. On 31 December 2017, a cheque for Sh.480,000 was received from a customer in settlement of a sales invoice for the same amount. The cheques were lodged into UTE's bank account. However, still on 31 December 2017, the customer returned the goods and also instructed his bankers not to pay the cheque. This instruction was carried out the same day but no entries in respect of these latter developments have been made in UTE's books. The cost of these goods amounting to Sh.320,000 was not included in the closing inventories.</p>\n<p>6. A cheque for Sh.840,000 from an insurance company in settlement of a claim for damage to inventory by fire had been paid into and credited by the bank on 21 December 2017, but an estimated amount of Sh.800,000 had been entered in UTE's income statement.</p>\n<p><b>Required:</b></p>\n<p>(i) Adjusted cash book as at 31 December 2017.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(4 marks)</p>\n<p>(ii) Bank reconciliation statement as at 31 December 2017.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(4 marks)</p>\n<p>(iii) Statement of corrected net profit for the year ended 31 December 2017.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(6 marks)</p>\n<p>(iv) Explain how the bank balance will be reported in UTE's final accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">(2 marks)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>(Total: 20 marks)</b></p>"
